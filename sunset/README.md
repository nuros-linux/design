# NurOS Iconpack Sunset - Design System

## Design
The main concept of NurOS Iconpack Sunset is inspired by the transition from day to night:
- Smooth color transitions like those on a sunset sky
- Warm, inviting atmosphere
- Balance between brightness and softness
- Harmony of natural shades
- Emotional connection to the time of day

## Color System

### Primary Palette
1. Base sunset shades:
   - Sunset Orange: #FF7E5F
   - Horizon Gold: #FEB47B
   - Sky Peach: #FFD5C2  
   These create the foundation for conveying the sunset atmosphere.

2. Accent colors:
   - Evening Purple: #9B6B9E
   - Dusk Blue: #4A7A96
   - Warm Rose: #E86B6B  
   These complement the primary palette, adding depth and dimension.

3. Transitional shades:
   - Twilight Gray: #7A6F7A
   - Sunset Beige: #E8D5C4
   - Evening Mauve: #9F8B93  
   These provide smooth transitions between the primary colors.

### Color Usage Rules

1. Basic principles:
   - Smooth gradients between 2-3 related colors
   - Warm tones as the foundation of the composition
   - Cool accents to create depth
   - Imitation of natural sunset lighting

2. Contrast and accessibility:
   - Soft contrast between elements: 2.8:1
   - Increased contrast for important information: 4:1
   - Ensuring distinguishability in bright lighting conditions

## Stylistic Standards

1. Geometry:
   - Main shape: rounded square with a 16px radius
   - Line thickness: 1.6px for primary elements
   - Inner padding: 6px from the edge
   - Grid size: 24x24px base size

2. Light and shadows:
   - Soft shadows with a warm hue
   - Light glow along the edges
   - Imitation of diffused evening light
   - Gradients transitioning to darker tones

3. Detailing:
   - Rounded, smooth shapes
   - Minimal sharp angles
   - Focus on silhouettes
   - Organic transitions between elements

## Implementation Recommendations

1. File Formats:
   - SVG with gradient support
   - PNG with transparency preserved
   - Optimization for different color profiles

2. Scalability:
   - Testing in sizes from 16x16px to 512x512px
   - Preserving gradient smoothness when scaling
   - Optimization for displays with varying color gamuts

3. Compatibility:
   - Adaptation to system color settings
   - Correct display on different screen types
   - Support for automatic theme switching modes

## Special Recommendations

1. Time of Day:
   - Ability to automatically adapt to the time of day
   - Smooth color temperature changes
   - Synchronization with system settings

2. Color Variations:
   - Morning version with cooler tones
   - Evening version with warmer shades
   - Ability to manually adjust color temperature
