DeltaDesign Concept is an icon design system consisting of three main themes: **Sunset**, **Night**, and **Light**, each tailored for different lighting conditions and user preferences. These themes offer unique visual styles inspired by natural transitions of day and night, with a focus on harmony and accessibility.

## Themes

### 1. **Sunset**

- Main colors: sunset oranges and golds, accented with evening purples and blues.

### 2. **Night**
- A dark theme designed for night-time usage, featuring deep, muted shades and soft transitions to reduce eye strain.
- Main colors: dark base tones with accents of night blues and purples.

### 3. **Light**
- A light theme focused on minimalism and clarity, providing an airy sense of space and visual harmony.
- Main colors: light base tones with pastel blue, green, and purple accents.
