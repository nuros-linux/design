# DeltaDesign Concept Night - Design System

## Design
The main concept of NurOS Iconpack Night is based on the following principles:
- Deep minimalism with a focus on comfortable nighttime use
- Soft transitions between shades
- Reduced contrast to reduce eye strain
- Maintaining readability in any lighting
- Elegance and modernity in every detail

## Color System

### Primary Palette
1. Base dark:
   - Primary Dark: #121212
   - Secondary Dark: #1E1E1E  
   These are used as the base for most icons, creating depth without aggressive blackness.

2. Accent colors:
   - Night Blue: #2D5B9E
   - Night Purple: #6B4BA3
   - Night Teal: #1C746C  
   Muted but distinguishable accents for key elements.

3. Neutral shades:
   - Surface Light: #3A3A3A
   - Surface Mid: #2C2C2C
   - Surface Dark: #1A1A1A  
   These create layering and tactility in the interface.

### Color Usage Rules

1. Basic principles:
   - A maximum of 2-3 colors per icon
   - The dark background always uses shades from the base palette
   - Accents are applied with reduced saturation
   - Gradients are used to create depth in dark tones

2. Contrast and accessibility:
   - Optimal contrast between elements: 2.5:1
   - Contrast of important elements: at least 3.5:1
   - All icons must be distinguishable at low screen brightness

## Stylistic Standards

1. Geometry:
   - Main shape: rounded square with a 14px radius
   - Line thickness: 1.8px for better visibility in the dark
   - Inner padding: at least 5px from the edge
   - Grid size: 24x24px base size

2. Shadows and volume:
   - Inner shadows: opacity 15%, soft spread
   - Light glow for accent elements
   - Use of gradients to create volume

3. Detailing:
   - Simplified shapes for better readability
   - Enlarged important elements
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Minimal small details

## Implementation Recommendations

1. File Formats:
   - SVG as the primary format
   - PNG with transparency preserved
   - Optimization of files for dark themes

2. Scalability:
   - Testing in sizes from 16x16px to 512x512px
   - Maintaining clarity in low light conditions
   - Optimization for OLED/AMOLED screens

3. Compatibility:
   - Automatic adaptation to system dark theme
   - Correct display on different types of screens
   - Support for various night lighting modes
