# DeltaDesign Concept Light - Design System

## Design
The main concept of NurOS Iconpack Light is based on the following principles:
- Minimalism and clean shapes
- Airiness and ease of perception
- Intuitive clarity
- Visual harmony and balance
- Functionality over decoration

## Color System

### Primary Palette
1. Base light:
   - Primary Light: #F8F9FA
   - Secondary Light: #E9ECEF  
   These are used as the base for most icons, creating a sense of purity and space.

2. Accent colors:
   - Accent Blue: #4B9FFF
   - Accent Green: #2ECC71
   - Accent Purple: #A463F2  
   These are used to highlight key elements and create visual hierarchy.

3. Neutral shades:
   - Neutral Dark: #212529
   - Neutral Mid: #495057
   - Neutral Light: #ADB5BD  
   These are used to create depth and contrast.

### Color Usage Rules

1. Basic principles:
   - A maximum of 2-3 colors per icon
   - The main background always uses base light shades
   - Accents are applied only to key elements
   - Gradients are used minimally and only in pastel tones

2. Contrast and accessibility:
   - Minimum contrast between elements: 3:1
   - Text element contrast: at least 4.5:1
   - All icons should be distinguishable in monochrome mode

## Stylistic Standards

1. Geometry:
   - Main shape: rounded square with a 12px radius
   - Line thickness: 1.5px for key elements
   - Inner padding: at least 4px from the edge
   - Grid size: 24x24px base size

2. Shadows and volume:
   - Light shadows: opacity 10%, offset 2px
   - Avoid deep shadows
   - Use translucency to create depth

3. Detailing:
   - Minimal details
   - Clear, distinguishable shapes
   - Readable symbols
   - No decorative elements

## Implementation Recommendations

1. File Formats:
   - SVG as the primary format
   - PNG for exporting in different sizes
   - ICON for icons
   - Optimization for web/desktop use

2. Scalability:
   - Testing in sizes from 16x16px to 512x512px
   - Maintaining clarity of lines during scaling
   - Optimization for different screen resolutions

3. Compatibility:
   - Support for light themes
   - Adaptation for different operating systems
   - Versatility in use
